# xkcd-1975-scraper
My humble attempt at a scraper to convert [XKCD 1975](https://xkcd.com/1975/)
into a GraphViz dot file.

Does not visualize any actions, does not support the "tags" functionality (so
it can't scrape anything where you need to click something first).

Produces huge output images, and also it has bugs.
